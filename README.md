# Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
### Intorduction
#### We were asked to help our friend Tom with analysing the results of a local election. The challenge was to use python, the command line, VS Code, and git Bash to run the analysis to determine the candidate winner and which county had the highest turnout. There were 3 candidates in the race and the vote were gathered from 3 different counties. The candidates in the election were
1. Charles Casper Stockham
2. Diana DeGette
3. Raymon Anthony Doane
#### The 3 counties that the results were gathered from were
1. Arapahoe
2. Denver
3. Jefferson
#### There were a total of 369,711 votes in total and we wanted to analyze all of the redults for a number of different metrics. This analysis will help to determine the winner of the election.
